Question 1:-

Title : Implementation of Traditional and Attention LSTM model.

1. Use Google colab or Jupyter notebook.

2. Open the file M22MA003_PA2_Ques1.py

3. Contents that will be displayed :-
   3.a. Tokenize the data and few examples visualised.
   3.b. Model with required embedding size and hidden layers.
   3.c. Training and Testing Modules in code.
   3.d. Utility functions such as counting parameters to be trained.
   3.e. Training the model for different set of embed_size and number_of_hid_layers.
   3.f. Display Loss and Correlation Table.
   3.f. Plotting the graph.

4. To run all the commands, use run all from the menu bar.
